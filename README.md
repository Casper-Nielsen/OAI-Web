# OAIWeb

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

You must create a config folder with the environments you wish to run in, for example if you wish to run the following environments:

- development
- production
- staging

You must create a json file for each in the config folder:
config/env.development.json
config/env.production.json
config/env.staging.json

Each json file must contain an object with an "ApiAddress" member:
```json
{
  "ApiAddress": "<Full URL of the API>"
}
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
